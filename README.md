# libmsdf

The wgpu SDF/MSDF rendering engine and typography stack, extracted from
matter-stream's render crates (`matterstream-common` / `-font` / `-ui-gpu`)
with all VM, skills, and card code pruned: SDF primitive instancing
(box / rounded-box / circle / line / Bézier stroke), MSDF text via font
atlases (baked at build time **and** generated at runtime by a WGSL compute
shader), rustybuzz shaping, and the `DrawList` contract that highbay_ui's
node-graph lowers into. Runs native and on wasm32 (WebGPU); includes the lo-fi
"pencil sketch" noise-distortion hook point (PLAN.md Phase 5).

Status: Phase 5 complete — extracted from matter-stream (VM/skills/cards pruned),
wgpu 29 SDF/MSDF renderer, runtime compute-shader MSDF generation matching the CPU
msdfgen baseline, dynamic atlas management, cubic-Bézier arc strokes, and the
`DrawList` render contract. Native + wasm32 (WebGPU) compile-clean; GPU tests run
headless on Metal. See `Cargo.toml` for the `cpu-bake` / `gpu-tests` feature notes.
